1. Tableau_Notebook1: for Tableau 10 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training For Data Science!    https://www.udemy.com/share/101WbsBkYYdF9RQQ==/
2. Tableau_Notebook2: for Tableau 10 Advanced Training: Master Tableau in Data Science   https://www.udemy.com/share/1013DoBkYYdF9RQQ==/


PREREQUISITEs? : 

Two tableau courses by Kirill Eremenko is a great resourse for learning tableau. 


FOR WHOM? : 

1. It's mainly for people who did these courses and wants to brush up their old tableau skills without needing them to go back to the video course.
2. For newlearners, After getting the basics right from the courses, just know that there is some written notes here which can be useful later. But remeber, TableauHack is definitely not a standalone guide to learn tableau. 
3. While working on a project in tableau, it's fairly common to forget some specific concepts or how to use them. TableauHack can be a great resource for this situation too. 


WHY? : 

I learned the tableau from fairly a lot of source. But the courses from Kiril Erimenko was a great start. But often times while working with tableau I found myself in the situation where I lost memory of some specific concept or how to apply them on my dashboards. So I need to go back to  video courses which can be little time consiming  and also not so convinient. I felt if there is a written note, it would be much easier to review. AND THUS MY FRIEND! TABLEAUHACK CAME TO SEE THE LIGHT !!

"There is a magic in graphs. The proﬁle of a curve reveals in a ﬂash a whole situation — the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces."
