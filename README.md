# TableauHack

WHAT IT IS:
TableauHack is a reference guide to use in conjuction with two tableau courses by Kirill Eremenko. 
1. Tableau 10 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training For Data Science!    https://www.udemy.com/share/101WbsBkYYdF9RQQ==/
2. Tableau 10 Advanced Training: Master Tableau in Data Science   https://www.udemy.com/share/1013DoBkYYdF9RQQ==/

PREREQUISITE: 
TableauHack is not a standalone guide. I believe the two tableau courses by Kirill Eremenko is a great resourse for learning tableau. TableauHack is a reference guide to use in conjunction with these two courses. 

FOR WHOM: 
1. It's mainly for people who did these courses and wants to brush up their old tableau skills without needing them to go back to the video course.
2. For newlearners, After getting the basics right from the courses, just know that there is some written notes here which can be useful later. 
3. While working on a project in tableau, it's fairly common to forget some specific concepts or how to use them. TableauHack can be a great resource for this situation too. 

WHY WE NEED IT: 

I learned the tableau from fairly a lot of source. But the courses from Kiril Erimenko was a great start. But often times while working with tableau I found myself in the situation where I lost memory of some specific concept or how to apply them on my dashboards. So I need to go back to Kiril's video courses which can be little time consiming  and also not so convinient. I felt if there is a written note, it would be much easier. AND THUS MY FRIEND! TABLEAU HACK CAME TO SEE THE LIGHT !!
